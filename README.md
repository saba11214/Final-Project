# Final-Project
Final Project For Drawing On The Web

http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~sa3806/drawing/final/

For the project I was inspired by the art history class I am currently taking, and we are mostly focusing on pop art. And all of the artists and paintings we've studied really tie into this class, in terms of the dynamic colors, and animation potential. In lectures, we aren't just learning about the features of the art, but their history; the main thing lacking in the artworks themselves is that history and significance behind them. That's what I want to do with this project, to add a life (make them alive in some sense) or significance back to the art that people might not realize when just looking at the art. I want to play with perspective, and have the user look at the art and the web page differently, not necessarily how we normally do.

The cover page I made a gallery with the three art works I am planning on manipulating. The two paintings will be regular paintings on the wall, but the sculpture will be seen through a window. I wanted to make them alive, so I made them breathe in a sense. The paintings I made them change in scale, up and down. The window I made it change opacity slightly, like if you were looking out of a window with the sun varying at different angles. All three link their respective web pages.

The first one I made was using David Hockney's painting of Pool With Two Figures. I put the painting into HTML Canvas to manipulate the pool using canvas shapes. The shape has a light opacity and I used JavaScript to animate it by changing the color to make the pool and the man in the pool to appear differently each time, playing with the idea of identity. I also added a pool balloon made like a dragon into the scene using Blender and WebGL, to add to the pool theme and add some user interactivity to give the scene a fluid feel when the user tries to move the balloon (it looks like it's floating or flying).

The second will be Roy Lichtenstein's 'I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It!'. For this one, I made a scene using WebGL. When the page loads the user will first see a blank black page with the painting in the middle. The user has the ability to rotate the room, and see what the person in the painting sees. I made a room, inspired by the 1960's, using Blender to make the furniture. I positioned them around the room and made a carpet like floor. I used JavaScript to continuously change the color of the light in the room, to give the room that creepy feeling you get when your alone.

The third will be a photograph of Claes Oldenburg's sculpture of a spoon and cherry. With this one I made it look like the cherry is a fountain and there is water shouting out of the spout. I controlled the animation using CSS to change its opacity and the mix blend mode to change the color as the water flows out, and the blending changes because the background has different colors. After some time in that animation, a rainbow will appear with its opacity changing like a natural rainbow would appear.
